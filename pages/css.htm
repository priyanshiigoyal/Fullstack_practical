    <p style="background-color: gray; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;" >CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, and is the 
        preferred way for setting the look and feel of a website. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language responsible for
         how your web pages will look like. It controls the colors, fonts, and layouts of your website elements.This style sheet 
         language also allows you to add effects or animations to your website. You can use it to display some CSS animations like 
         click button effects, spinners or loaders, and animated backgrounds. Without CSS, your website will appear as a plain HTML page. </p>
