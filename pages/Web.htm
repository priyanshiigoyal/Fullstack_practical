    <p style="font-size: 18px;background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Web development is a specific field of software engineering that focuses on building web pages. Web pages, or web apps, are
         codebases that are downloaded and run in our web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) each time a user navigates to the website 
         address. This differs from other software which is usually downloaded once and run as a standalone application on your
          computer or phone. Web development makes for an exciting career, as a web development cycle is usually much shorter and you
           get to iterate over your software at a much faster rate.</p>
